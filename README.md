# auto-splicer
An Amazon Transcribe powered audio splicer.
Requires Pydub, boto3 and tkinter to work so make sure to install them first.

This is a relatively simple python program which, with valid provided credentials, allows you to use Amazon's transcribe service to detect spoken words in an audio file, make clips out of them, and then use text based input to play clips. So it's an automatic sentence mixer really.
